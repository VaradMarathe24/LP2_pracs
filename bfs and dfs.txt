| **Feature**              | **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**                                                                              | **DFS (Depth-First Search)**                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Traversal Order**      | Level by level (explores neighbors before going deeper).                                                    | Goes as deep as possible down one path before backtracking.                                                  |
| **Data Structure Used**  | Queue (FIFO)                                                                                                | Stack (LIFO) or recursion (which uses the system call stack).                                                |
| **Optimal for**          | Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.                                                             | Exploring all possible paths or finding a path in a tree/graph.                                              |
| **Time Complexity**      | O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.                                   | O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.                                    |
| **Space Complexity**     | O(V) due to the queue storing nodes at the current level.                                                   | O(V) due to the recursion stack (or explicit stack).                                                         |
| **Pathfinding**          | Can find the shortest path (if weights are equal) in an unweighted graph.                                   | Does not guarantee the shortest path.                                                                        |
| **Exploration**          | Explores nodes level by level, ensuring all nodes at one depth are visited before moving to the next depth. | Explores as deep as possible along one branch before backtracking to explore other branches.                 |
| **Memory Usage**         | Typically higher memory usage due to storing all nodes at the current level in the queue.                   | Memory usage depends on the depth of the tree/graph, often lower than BFS but can grow if the graph is deep. |
| **Use Case**             | Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal.                                                  | Pathfinding in deep graphs, solving puzzles, or searching for solutions where backtracking is needed.        |
| **Type of Graphs Used**  | Can be used in both directed and undirected graphs.                                                         | Can be used in both directed and undirected graphs.                                                          |
| **Edge Classification**  | Doesn't classify edges (useful in other algorithms like DFS for edge classification).                       | Classifies edges into tree edges, back edges, and forward edges.                                             |
| **Example Applications** | Web crawling, finding the shortest path in a maze, broadcasting in networks.                                | Solving puzzles like mazes, topological sorting, cycle detection in graphs.                                  |
